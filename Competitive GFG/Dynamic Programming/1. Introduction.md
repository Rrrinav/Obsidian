**Dynamic Programming** is an algorithmic approach to solve some complex problems easily and save time and number of comparisons by storing the results of past computations. The basic idea of dynamic programming is to store the results of previous calculation and reuse it in future instead of recalculating them.  
  
> _We can also see Dynamic Programming as dividing a particular problem into sub-problems and then storing the result of these sub-problems to calculate the result of the actual problem._  

  
  
Consider the problem to **_find the Nth Fibonacci number_**.  
  
We know that nth Fibonacci number fib(n) can be defined as:  
	fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2), where n >= 2.
and
	fib(0) = 0 
	fib(1) = 1

  
  
We can see that the above function fib() to find the nth Fibonacci number is divided into two sub-problems fib(n-1) and fib(n-2) each one of which will be further divided into sub-problems and so on.  
The first few Fibonacci numbers are:  
> _1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,_........  

The recursive program to find N-th Fibonacci number is shown below:  

```cpp
int fib(int n)  
{   
	if (n <= 1)          
	return n;       
	return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);  
}
```

 
Below is the recursion tree for the recursive solution to find the nth Fibonacci number:  
```txt
              fib(5)
               /             \
               fib(4)                fib(3)
             /      \                /     \
         fib(3)      fib(2)         fib(2)    fib(1)
        /     \        /    \       /    \
  fib(2)   fib(1)  fib(1) fib(0) fib(1) fib(0)
  /    \
fib(1) fib(0)

```


We can see that the function fib(3) is being called 2 times. If we would have stored the value of fib(3), then instead of computing it again, we could have reused the old stored value.  
  
The **time complexity** of the _recursive solution_ is **exponential**. However, we can improve the time complexity by using Dynamic Programming approach and storing the results of the subproblems as shown below:  

```cpp
int fib(int n)  
{    
	// Declare an array to store Fibonacci numbers   
	int f[n+2];   // 1 extra to handle case, n = 0    
	int i;       // 0th and 1st number of the series are 0 and 1   
	f[0] = 0;    
	f[1] = 1;       
	for (i = 2; i <= n; i++)    
	{        
	// Add the previous 2 numbers in the series        
	// and store it        
	f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2];    
	}       
	return f[n];  
}
```

The **time complexity** of the above solution is _**linear**_.
