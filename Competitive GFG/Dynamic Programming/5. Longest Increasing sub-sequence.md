The Longest Increasing Sub-sequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest sub-sequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the sub-sequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for {10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80} is 6 and LIS is {10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}.

**Examples:** 

**Input:** arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
**Output:** Length of LIS = 3
The longest increasing sub-sequence is 3, 10, 20

**Input:** arr[] = {3, 2}
**Output:** Length of LIS = 1
The longest increasing sub-sequences are {3} and {2}

**Input:** arr[] = {50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80}
**Output:** Length of LIS = 4
The longest increasing sub-sequence is {3, 7, 40, 80}

**Method 1:** Recursion.  
_**Optimal Substructure:**_ Let arr[0..n-1] be the input array and L(i) be the length of the LIS ending at index i such that arr[i] is the last element of the LIS.

Then, L(i) can be recursively written as: 

L(i) = 1 + max( L(j) ) where 0 < j < i and arr[j] < arr[i]; or
L(i) = 1, if no such j exists.

To find the LIS for a given array, we need to return max(L(i)) where 0 < i < n.  
Formally, the length of the longest increasing sub-sequence ending at index i, will be 1 greater than the maximum of lengths of all longest increasing sub-sequences ending at indices before i, where arr[j] < arr[i] (j < i).  
Thus, we see the LIS problem satisfies the optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to sub-problems.

The recursive tree given below will make the approach clearer:  

Input  : arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 11}
**f(i): Denotes LIS of subarray ending at index 'i'**

(LIS(1)=1)
 
        f(4)  {f(4) = 1 + max(f(1), f(2), f(3))}
     /    |    \
     f(1)  f(2)  f(3) {f(3) = 1, f(2) and f(1) are > f(3)}
       |     |   \
      f(1)  f(2)  f(1) {f(2) = 1 + max(f(1)}
              |
            f(1) {f(1) = 1}

Below is the implementation of the recursive approach:

```cpp
/* A Naive C++ recursive implementation
of LIS problem */
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/* To make use of recursive calls, this
function must return two things:
1) Length of LIS ending with element arr[n-1].
	We use max_ending_here for this purpose
2) Overall maximum as the LIS may end with
	an element before arr[n-1] max_ref is
	used this purpose.
The value of LIS of full array of size n
is stored in *max_ref which is our final result
*/
int _lis(int arr[], int n, int* max_ref)
{
	/* Base case */
	if (n == 1)
		return 1;

	// 'max_ending_here' is length of LIS
	// ending with arr[n-1]
	int res, max_ending_here = 1;

	/* Recursively get all LIS ending with arr[0],
	arr[1] ... arr[n-2]. If arr[i-1] is smaller
	than arr[n-1], and max ending with arr[n-1]
	needs to be updated, then update it */
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		res = _lis(arr, i, max_ref);
		if (arr[i - 1] < arr[n - 1]
			&& res + 1 > max_ending_here)
			max_ending_here = res + 1;
	}

	// Compare max_ending_here with the overall
	// max. And update the overall max if needed
	if (*max_ref < max_ending_here)
		*max_ref = max_ending_here;

	// Return length of LIS ending with arr[n-1]
	return max_ending_here;
}

// The wrapper function for _lis()
int lis(int arr[], int n)
{
	// The max variable holds the result
	int max = 1;

	// The function _lis() stores its result in max
	_lis(arr, n, &max);

	// returns max
	return max;
}

/* Driver program to test above function */
int main()
{
	int arr[] = { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60 };
	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	cout <<"Length of lis is "<< lis(arr, n);
	return 0;
}

```

**Output**

Length of lis is 5

**Complexity Analysis:** 

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this recursive approach is exponential as there is a case of overlapping subproblems as explained in the recursive tree diagram above.
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1). No external space used for storing values apart from the internal stack space.

**Method 2:** Dynamic Programming.  
We can see that there are many subproblems in the above recursive solution which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and recomputation of same subproblems can be avoided by either using Memoization or Tabulation.

The simulation of approach will make things clear:

Input  : arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 11}
LIS[] = {1, 1, 1, 1} (initially)

**Iteration-wise simulation :** 

1. arr[2] > arr[1] {LIS[2] = max(LIS [2], LIS[1]+1)=2}
2. arr[3] < arr[1] {No change}
3. arr[3] < arr[2] {No change}
4. arr[4] > arr[1] {LIS[4] = max(LIS [4], LIS[1]+1)=2}
5. arr[4] > arr[2] {LIS[4] = max(LIS [4], LIS[2]+1)=3}
6. arr[4] > arr[3] {LIS[4] = max(LIS [4], LIS[3]+1)=3}

We can avoid recomputation of subproblems by using tabulation as shown in the below code: 

Below is the implementation of the above approach:  
```cpp
/* Dynamic Programming C++ implementation
of LIS problem */
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

/* lis() returns the length of the longest
increasing subsequence in arr[] of size n */
int lis(int arr[], int n)
{
	int lis[n];

	lis[0] = 1;

	/* Compute optimized LIS values in
	bottom up manner */
	for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
		lis[i] = 1;
		for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
			if (arr[i] > arr[j] && lis[i] < lis[j] + 1)
				lis[i] = lis[j] + 1;
	}

	// Return maximum value in lis[]
	return *max_element(lis, lis + n);
}

/* Driver program to test above function */
int main()
{
	int arr[] = { 10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60 };
	int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
	printf("Length of lis is %d\n", lis(arr, n));

	return 0;
}
```
**Output**

Length of lis is 5

**Complexity Analysis:** 

- **Time Complexity:** O(n2).   
    As nested loop is used.
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(n).   
    Use of any array to store LIS values at each index.

**Method 3 :** Memoization DP

This is extension of recursive method

We can see that there are many subproblems in the above recursive solution which are solved again and again. So this problem has Overlapping Substructure property and re-computation of same sub-problems can be avoided by either using Memoization
```cpp
/* A Naive C++ recursive implementation
of LIS problem */
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

/* To make use of recursive calls, this
function must return two things:
1) Length of LIS ending with element arr[n-1].
	We use max_ending_here for this purpose
2) Overall maximum as the LIS may end with
	an element before arr[n-1] max_ref is
	used this purpose.
The value of LIS of full array of size n
is stored in *max_ref which is our final result
*/

int f(int idx, int prev_idx, int n, int a[],
	vector<vector<int> >& dp)
{
	if (idx == n) {
		return 0;
	}

	if (dp[idx][prev_idx + 1] != -1) {
		return dp[idx][prev_idx + 1];
	}

	int notTake = 0 + f(idx + 1, prev_idx, n, a, dp);
	int take = INT_MIN;
	if (prev_idx == -1 || a[idx] > a[prev_idx]) {
		take = 1 + f(idx + 1, idx, n, a, dp);
	}

	return dp[idx][prev_idx + 1] = max(take, notTake);
}
// Function to find length of longest increasing
// subsequence.
int longestSubsequence(int n, int a[])
{
	vector<vector<int> > dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, -1));
	return f(0, -1, n, a, dp);
}

/* Driver program to test above function */
int main()
{
	int a[] = { 3, 10, 2, 1, 20 };
	int n = sizeof(a) / sizeof(a[0]);
	cout << "Length of lis is " << longestSubsequence(n, a);
	return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
Length of lis is 3
